=====================
====GENERAL NOTES:===
=====================
- all entries must have the same square-shape, color, and be a power of 2 
- 512 by 512 is a good resolution for capturing patterns
- DANGEROUS TRAP: every dataset has black and white images
  - mixing too different color spaces makes everything crash
  - RGB works much bette in StyleGAN
- must all be converted to tf.records format
- StyleGAN v2 is very data-hungry, so the more images the better
- NVIDIA folks already trained on a ffhq model, and this is all trained on top of that, which speeds up training immensley, so that's why we may see faces at early ticks lol

============
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** AQUIRING DATASET ***
1) create dataset by running scraper.py (scraped 12 pages with 80 images per page = 960 images total) on normal stuar Desktop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** PREPROCESSING ***
2) convert the images in the dataset to the same square-shape resolution with an RGB colorspace
- let's do this on the paperspace server (login on command prompt with ssh paperspace@74.82.30.238 | manually type TJEKM26BPefQ)
- I started the server then clicked "open terminal" --> it crashed, then I tried logging in via command prompt and it actually worked
- cd Desktop (enter directory)
- cd ../ (leave)

### PAPERSPACE server cannot access your computer, so you must download the met959 folder in the paperspace server ###
- upload met959 folder to Google Drive and download on Paperspace machine --> then move from downloads > Desktop and extract to Desktop
- once completed, go to CP and type cd Desktop/met959 to enter the folder
- SILVERBULLET COMMAND: mogrify -verbose -type truecolor -format jpg -thumbnail 512x512^ -gravity center -extent 512x512 *
  - * = everything in the directory
  - cropping down to center square of each iamge
- before running the command, make a copy of the folder (on Paperspace machine (server)) just to be safe
- running the command multiple times over the same image(s) doesn't harm anything
- open up another terminal on Paperspace terminal and do sudo apt install htop
- then type htop --> so we can see how efficiently and fast the server converts the images
- NOW RUN THE COMMAND (make sure you're in the Desktop/met959 directory on the Paperspace server)
- the process is lightning fast on the Paperspace server, in which we can see in seconds how all the images in the met959 folder are 512x512 and RGB

*** PREPROCESSING ***
3) from https://github.com/dvschultz/stylegan2
"CUSTOM: create custom datasets by placing all training images under a single directory. 
The images must be square-shaped and they must all have the same power-of-two dimensions. 
To convert the images to multi-resolution TFRecords, run:"
python dataset_tool.py create_from_images ~/datasets/my-custom-dataset ~/my-custom-images
python dataset_tool.py display ~/datasets/my-custom-dataset

- but FIRST: git clone https://github.com/dvschultz/stylegan2 (now we have stylegan2 folder on Paperspace server)
- cd stylegan2 (should be in stylegan2 directory)
- bash ./easy-install.sh
- mkdir raw_datasets (creates a folder in stylegan2 folder) 
- now, we must move the met959 folder from Desktop --> stylegan2 ---> raw_datasets, in which we can just search stylegan2 and drag it in the raw_datasets folder
- cd raw_datasets
- ls (should see just met959)

- AS SHOWN ABOVE, WE WILL BE WORKING WITH (in which we must edit):  
- python dataset_tool.py create_from_images ~/datasets/my-custom-dataset ~/my-custom-images <--- function to produce custom dataset
  - ~/datasets/my-custom-dataset = where files are going to go
  - ~/my-custom-images = the raw dataset

TYPE IN COMMAND PROMPT: 
- cd ../ (to go back into stylegan2 directory and out of raw_datasets folder)
- python dataset_tool.py create_from_images ~/stylegan2/datasets/met959 ./raw_datasets/met959 (let's just give them the same name for convenience)
- should work, but if we get "no such module error" --> then do cd ../ --> pip install --user tqdm (tqdm is the module I apparently didn't have)
- NOW, when it works: look in newly created datasets folder
  - we see a met959 folder 
  - we see met959 consits of TF.records files :D
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TRAINING ***
4) actually, i am going to rename the met959 folder inside of datasets to met959TFR
- RIGHT NOW WE ARE JUST IN THE stylegan2 DIRECTORY
- we can do ls datasets/met959TFR to see our tf.records files

- now, from https://github.com/dvschultz/stylegan2
"TRAINING NETWORKS"
python run_training.py --num-gpus=8 --data-dir=~/datasets --config=config-f \
  --dataset=ffhq --mirror-augment=true

- we need to EDIT the above code:
(paperspace only uses 1 GPU)
(add . --> --data-dir=~/datasets becomes --data-dir=./datasets)
(~ says it's in root folder, but that's not our case)
(changed data= to our dataset)
(mirror augmentation = randomly flips some of the images being trained left or right | if text, turn it off, otherwise, keep it on) 
(added --metrics=None | metrics are a way for data scientists to know how well their training is going... for us, however, we are going to be reliant on our eyes) 
(metrics can also add a lot of additional training time) 

REVISED, FINAL TRAINING COMMAND TO ENTER: 
- python run_training.py --num-gpus=1 --data-dir=./datasets --config=config-f --dataset=met959TFR --mirror-augment=true --metrics=None
  - was giving me a ton of errors at first, but I forgot to check the github stylegan2 requirements
  - to train in background (if it were to take days), I could do: 
  - nohup python run_training.py --num-gpus=1 --data-dir=./datasets --config=config-f --dataset=met959TFR --mirror-augment=true --metrics=None
  - make sure to check the nohup.out file in the stylegan2 directory
